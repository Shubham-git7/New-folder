      "I’ve worked on a variety of web projects, such as 'Netflix-GPT' and 'Obges Agency Clone,' which allowed me to sharpen my skills in React, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. Though these projects were built following tutorials, they helped me understand how to bring complex ideas to life. Creativity and problem-solving are at the core of everything I do. I love taking on challenges that push me to think outside the box and find innovative solutions. My goal is to continue growing as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and make a positive impact through technology.",
